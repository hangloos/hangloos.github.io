I am writing this blog post after my completion of my Rails App with Jquery assessment. At first jquery did not come as easy to me as Rails did. The more defined structure of rails resonated with me quicker. The main reason I was able to learn Jquery, was by taking a step by step approach. 

No matter where you are in any program you are creating you should always know exactly where you are in your code as you navigate through it. I focused on slowing down my coding and making sure I could talk through where my program was taking me next. This was done by watching the rails server and javascript console logs very closely. I would constantly place debuggers and prys in my program when I was confused. Triggering these would confirm my location as I progressed. Understanding this overall flow was a huge turning point for me in my learning. 

Not only the flow but also understanding what you're actually getting back when using jquery. The best way to understand the data is to actually see it! Use Pry and Debugger each step of the way to do so. 

TIP: 

To me, understanding the pattern of your code is an essential part of development. I have found that writing out your steps in a descriptive format before coding them along with writing out what is actually happening after you are coding it will help you create your program very successfully. By writing out what was actually happening, I was able to debug much easier and cleaner. Be descriptive and take the necessary time to complete your program step by step. 

Happy coding!!

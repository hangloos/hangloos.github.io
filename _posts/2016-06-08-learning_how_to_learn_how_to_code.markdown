I am currently on week 17 of my coding journey and I am still improving on things that I thought I learned a long time ago. I am referring to the process of learning something. Throughout working through Learn Verified through the Flatiron School, I have realized I did not know what I was doing when I graduated from college 5 years ago. When I began my lessons with Flatiron, I was rushing. I was trying to get things passing as fast as possible. I wanted to see more green! (passing tests) The deeper I got into the coding, the more I realized I was missing something. The big picture. 

Learning how to code, is 100% not about speed. It is about understanding how every little thing works in everything you do. If you see something that doesn't make 100% sense, then you can't move on till you understand it. This process NEEDS to include talking out the vocabulary, the concepts and how the programs are running to yourself. Yes, talking to yourself. 

Flatiron does an amazing job teaching you how to code, but you need to approach the school the right way. Since my realization with my learning style, I have made significant jumps in learning how to code. But the best thing about the realization is learning at an approach that will benefit me in the long run. My new career. Nothing good is rushed.

Some tips relating to program:

1. Organize your program before coding. Use pseucodcode for this. 
2. Write out and talk out your relationships in your programs. This will give you bullet points on each class that can help you when making your program. 
3. If you are repeating yourself, stop and take a step back. 
4. Pry around all the time, and then pry some more. 

Good luck to all the newbie coders and hopefully this gave you some insight that will help you when starting your journey.

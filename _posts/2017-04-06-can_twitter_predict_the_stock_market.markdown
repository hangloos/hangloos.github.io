A big topic in the financial industry right now has to do with social media information affecting the price of stocks. Specifically the information on twitter. There are even rumors that the SEC might step in to regulate twitter. They will aim at stopping the automated and bot tweeting used to affect the perception of certain stocks which ultimately swing the price of the stock. Companies will use this approach to swing a price in the direction that will benefit them. 

Social media has created a new wave of technology created by financial and analytics company to help get an upper hand on stock behavior prediction. Using AI, multiple factors related to the relevance of individuals profiles and massive scans of social media APIs, companies are able to locate market and stock trends before they happen. 


Here is a real life example:

In 2013 Blackberry's buyout deal went south and a Canadian newspaper released the news to the world. This was going to cause the price of the stock to plummet once Wall Street got the news. 3 minutes later this happened. However, a data analytics company out of NYC Dataminr who mines social media to predict the market was able to get this news within seconds and make a huge profit by shorting the stock. Pretty crazy! This is just one of many examples that focus around this shift in the financial world. 

Technology is changing the world and we constantly need to adapt to changing times to stay ahead of the curve. Information is fast and will only become faster. Keep learning and keep innovating. 

Happy coding!

Since graduation, I have been doing some freelance website development. This has required me to dive into SEO and how Google actually ranks websites. SEO (search engine optimization) is determined by many factors and is how you can move your website up in the search rankings based on keywords. Yes, there are other search engines but let us face it, Google controls about 70% of the market. Besides a few individuals at Google, no one knows exactly what the ranking factors are. 

There is a December 2016 study conducted by search metrics that looked at 10,000 keywords, tracked over 20 billion social media signals, 5 billion links, and 100,000 website factors over the course of the year. This is probably the most accurate guess at what Google's algorithm actually is. 

The categories are content, user signals, technical, user experience, social signals, and backlinks. This can be grouped into 4 categories - social media, links, content and website factors. 

Social media is measured by Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter and Google+ activity that your website has. Links are measured by the quality of other websites that are linking to you. Content is related to your keywords and content that you have in your posts, pictures etc. Lastly, website factors have to do with how fast your website loads, how long people spend on your website, and how mobile friendly it is. 

If this interests you, here is a link to the study's infographic of the measurements. Feel free to shoot me an email ericloos00@gmail.com. I'd be more than happy to talk more about the types of things you can do to enhance these categories Google measures.

During my final project I used the popular Boostrap framework to design my application. Bootstrap is a very powerful framework but can be a little robust at times. I decided to try a newer framework called Semantic UI halfway through my project. Most of my application was working the way I had planned it out, I just need it to look much cleaner. Semantic UI takes what Bootstrap offers with a large assortment of UI tools but in an extremely straightforward approach. Here is an example of a boostrap button versus a semantic button. 

Bootstrap - <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
Semantic - <button class="ui button">Primary</button>

This is a very basic example, but I think it shows you the style in which Semantic takes. I was able to take my application and drastically improve the UI of it within in a much shorter time using Boostrap. The spacing and column issues I was having with Bootstrap did not happen when using Semantic. Not only does it help the looks but you are able to integerate with many other frameworks to help organize your UI layer alongside your application logic. Some frameworks are Angular, React, Meteor and Ember. 


If you haven't already, give it a shot! There is a reason Semantic's defined as "relating to meaning in language or logic".

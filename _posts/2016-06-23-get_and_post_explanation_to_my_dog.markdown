I have recently just finished up my Sinatra lessons for the Flatiron Web Dev course. This included a lot of get and post code. I thought it would be helpful to explain how get and post work like I was explaining it to my dog Harper. 

Get and Post are commands that describe what your program should do next. Based on what you type in as your get, the program with that part will start. This part has code underneath it that tells what will happen next. This will be certain descriptions that will create or do things for the end result while eventually migrating the the program to somewhere else. This could be another place in the program or also an actual document. These documents have information that we can use to show the original person that went to this part of the website something. So essentially we are going and getting information somewhere so we can see it! 

Example - Someone goes to /newyork on a website. This would alert your program at get '/newyork' and would make the details below it work. 


When a user enters information into a website, this information will get "posted" somewhere. This will start a place in our program based on where its posted to. If its posted to /newyork then post '/newyork' will run in our program and all the details after will work. These will also create things or reference to somewhere else so that we can ultimately show that first person something. So essentially we are going and getting information that was entered and using that to go somewhere to see it. The get and post of our program control what we look for and use to be able to ultimately show someone something on the internet. 

It is important to remember that the file that displays things can use the information provided on the get or post part that was previously used. This will let us display things that are in our current program. 

Hope this was helpful Harper!

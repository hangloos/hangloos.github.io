I have recently just finished up my Sinatra lessons for the Flatiron Web Dev course. This included a lot of get and post code.  I thought it would be helpful to explain how get and post work like I was explaining it to my dog Harper. 

Get and Post are commands that describe how you would interact with a website. Based on what you type in as your get, the program will go to that part of the program and follow what you tell it to do after ( your code )  So if I get '/facebook' then my progam will go to my code that lists get '/facebook. We will call this the URL. The word Get is telling the program to go get the information that is listed in my program after the URL. This will tell us what to do next. Based on the instructions that follow we will create certain things and get redirected to another URL in the program or to an actual file. This file will have code on it that will show certain things in a browser. So essentially we are going and getting information somewhere so we can see it! 

When a user enters information into a website, this information will get "posted" somewhere. When we call post on some URL, this is going to go to that part of the program and retrieve whatever information was posted to that. We can use this information to create, save things to make our program do useful things. It then will tell us where to go next in the program. This could be a new url or to an actualy file that is displayed in the brower. So essentially we are going and getting information that was entered and using that to go somewhere to see it. 

It is important to remember that the file that displays things can use the information provided on the get or post part that was previously used. This will let us display things that are in our current program. 

Hope this was helpful Harper!

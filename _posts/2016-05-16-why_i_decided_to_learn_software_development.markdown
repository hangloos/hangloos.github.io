My first real involvement with software development was in late 2012 when I help found a technology company called CoatChex. I ran the operations of the company but was involved with our technology in many facets. Throughout my life, I have always easily operated technology but never really thought about how it actually worked. Seeing actual code, bugs and the changes to our company's software opened my eyes to what is "actual technology."

Throughout the past 3-4 years of startup experience, I have had many ups and downs. One common theme with the "downs" was not having enough control or understanding of the technology we were using or building. After having this realization, I began to dive more and more into the actual code behind the software. I saw so many similarities with coding programs and building financial models in excel. Excel was a tool I learned in college with great success and have used professionally ever since. Creating is a passion of mine and Coding soon joined. I am focused on growing a long career in software development and further growing my skills to create and make a difference in the world. 

My startup experience has given me many valuable skills as I've had to wear pretty much every hat in business. Lets add another hat! 

Let the journey begin!!

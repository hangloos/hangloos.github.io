My first real involvement with software development was in late 2012 when I help found a technology company called CoatChex. I ran the operations of the company but was involved with our technology in many facets, mostly QA. Throughout my life, I have always easily operated technology but never really thought about how it actually worked. Seeing actual code, bugs and the changes to our company's software opened my eyes to what is "actual technology."

Throughout the past 3-4 years of startup experience, I have had many ups and downs. One common theme with the "downs" was not having enough control or understanding of the technology we were using or building. After having this realization, I began to dive more and more into the actual code behind the software. I saw so many similarities with coding programs and building financial models in excel. Excel was a tool I learned in college with great success and have used professionally ever since. This brought me to the conclusion that I need to learn software development. Not only was it a great interest of mine but it was a career decision to learn an invaluable skill for the future. 

My startup experience has given me many valuable skills as I've had to wear pretty much every hat in business. But when trying to tangibly put those skills on "paper", it became more difficult. Software development to me is something that can easily be put on "paper" and something that I can excel in given my personality and background. 

Let the journey begin!!
